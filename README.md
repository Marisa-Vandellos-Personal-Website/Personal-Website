# Personal-Website

My first project for the Fullstack Academy Grace Hopper part-time bootcamp.
A sample personal site for a team member. Includes a home page introducing the team member, an about page describing said team member, and a portfolio page with the team member's websites.
This project is mostly HTML files, with a little CSS and a basic Hello World JavaScript file. All of the editing was done in the VS Code IDE.

To use this project, clone the repo down to your local computer or download the code directly, then open a server to view the website.
